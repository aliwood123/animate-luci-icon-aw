# Animate SVG Icons with CSS

## Why? 
* Understand the parts of SVG elements that can be animated
* CSS Animations are lightweight and easy to implement and improve user experience
* Learn CSS tranforms, transitions, and keyframes
* Add existing animation libraries to your project and save time
* Use SVG icons in your future projects

## How?
* Use CSS `@keyframes` to define animations
* Use `transform` and `transition` properties to animate SVG elements
* Use `animation` property to apply animations to SVG elements

* Background gradient from [uiGradients](https://uigradients.com/#Dusk)

## Notes
* Attempted to move background position to give the appearance the background gradient was animated by wrapping svg in div element and applying the animation to the div element instead of the svg element, but I couldn't get it to work. Followed steps in first 7 minutes of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zadj2i5wUyc, then used debugger in CodePen and ChatGPT to figure out why it was still not moving, but still couldn't find the problem.
